          <div class="content is-normal">

            <p class="subtitle"> Do plan ahead</p>

            <p>Have and use some sort of planning tool. Whether it’s an app on your phone or a physical agenda planner, jotting down all the things you have to do will help ensure that you don’t forget anything. As soon as you find out about an event, are given an assignment or schedule a new appointment, add it to your calendar; even if it’s as simple as a lunch date with a friend next Thursday. This will help you stay on top of your work and remind you of upcoming events</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> Do get organized!</p> 

             <p>Color-code each area of your life. Use a different color for each class, work, extracurricular activities, appointments, and personal life to keep all the things in your planner separated and clear. Label your binders, file important paperwork, and sort through the things that you do and don’t need on a regular basis.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> DO set goals!</p>

            <p>Daily, weekly, monthly – whatever keeps you on track! First things first, set accomplishable goals. Be realistic with yourself and what you are capable of completing within a certain amount of time. Write these goals down where you will see them frequently, like on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Keep a to-do list, prioritize what needs to be done first, and cross things off as you complete them. This will help you see how much you’ve accomplished over a particular duration of time. </p> 

            <p class="subtitle"> Do stay focused!</p>

            <p>Set a specific time every day that is designated toward working on assignments. Limit distractions by turning off your phone while working on homework and work in an area that doesn’t disturb your train of thought. Find someone to study with who can hold you accountable to actually complete your tasks. Set yourself up to be productive and successful and see how much more you get done in a faster amount of time!</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle"> Do take breaks!</p>
            <p>Give yourself a “brain break” by setting a healthy study-to-break ratio. This could be set as 45 minutes of studying with 10 minute breaks in between, for example. But find whatever works for you! During breaks, try exercising, getting outside, drinking water, eating a healthy snack, talking to a friend, or rewarding yourself with a few minutes on your phone. Set timers to keep yourself on track! Although it may not seem like it is necessary to take a break that frequently, these few minutes can help you feel rewarded as dopamine is released into your brain in order to make you feel happy and give you a sense of accomplishment.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Don't procrastinate</p>
            
            <p>Waiting until the last minute to complete your assignments only puts more pressure and stress on yourself. Once you find out about an assignment or project, start it right away in order to stay on top of things and not let them pile up! This guarantees you will get things done and turned in in a timely manner, perhaps even early! Starting your assignments early also allows you to consult your professor or peers about any problems you might come across before turning it in.</p>


            <p class="subtitle"> Don't isolate yourself!</p> 

            <p>Make sure to reward your good habits of managing your time by scheduling in some free time for yourself. Get out and spend time with your friends when you can. If this isn’t possible, plan to study with a group of friends or meet at a coffee shop to finish up whatever you need to do. Mixing socialization and productivity can be super helpful.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> Don't cut out necessary tasks!</p>  

            <p>When you’ve got a lot to do and feel like there just aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done, you’ll sometimes find yourself cutting out things to fit in others. Some of the easiest things to cut out include eating, exercising, and showering. But these are also some of the things that are essential to our well-being. Cutting out dinner may make it seem like you’ll have an extra thirty minutes to work, but your brain also needs that energy from a meal to function. Don’t forget that your health (and hygiene) are just as important as that paper you have due at midnight.</p>

            <p class="subtitle"> Don't overbook!</p>

             <p>It’s important to remember that it’s okay to say no to things! Sometimes you have to put yourself and your priorities first. Learn to recognize when you’ve got plenty on your plate and when it would be too much to take on more. If someone asks you to help them, consider whether you will still be able to meet your deadlines in time. It’s okay to put you and your grades first.</p>

             <p class="subtitle"> Don't underestimate!</p> 

            <p>Not everything will go right when you study. This means it’s time to plan for the unexpected. Plan for interruptions, distractions, last minute changes, bad internet and bad lab partners. All of this will add to the amount of time you need for each assignment. This way you won’t miss that midnight deadline anytime. </p>
            
          
            <p>When you’ve got a lot going on and it feels impossible to make time for everything, make sure to think back and incorporate some of these tips. It’s never too late to build on your time management skills and, hopefully, this blog gave you some ideas on how to organize and prepare better in the future.</p>

            <p>Just remember: it’s only good time management when you can actually manage everything. So be realistic, and learn to accept that not everything can be done in just one day.</p>

           <p class="title">Brief conclusions</p>

            <p> Time is limited, day contains only 24h and time lost can't be made up but on the following day. That's at the price of delaying or postponing something else. </p>
            <p>Experts seem to agree that to manage one's time, one needs to be realistic (no overbooking, no understating). Time should be planned and organized wisely. There should be priorities, focus and follow thru. Routine helps when it is possible,but one has to be able to be flexible if needed. It is ok to delegate, say no or multitask when appropriate. One needs to be aware and analyse its shortcomings (procrastination or bad habits) in order to eliminate them. Lastly, it also matters to take breaks (already pre-planned) and take care of oneself by doing the things that matter to us and that we planned ahead.</p>

              <h3>People who beleive they thrive in chaos typically have to work alone</h3>
              
              <p>A big part of being successful at time management is being organized. But what if you happen to be a disorganized person? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. After all, you may have never been taught proper organizational skills or maybe you grapple with something beyond your control, like ADHD. You might even be one of the few who thrive in chaos, but you still need to learn how to manage your time - whether you’re organized by nature or not. When you don’t manage your time deadlines creep up on you, projects go unfinished and important tasks are forgotten. This make you stressed out and puts your company in jeopardy.The good news is that by following these six tips you will get better at managing your time, no matter how disorganized you are.</p>

              <p class="subtitle">Evaluate how you spend your time</p>

              <p>Do you always feel like there aren’t enough hours in a day? Are you frequently missing deadlines? Do you ever feel like you have time to do the things you enjoy?

              Sure, there are times when you’re busy and unable to meet a friend for lunch. But we all have 24 hours in a day. Why can’t you meet a deadline or find 15 minutes to read when others can? It may be because your lifestyle is preventing you from properly managing your time.
            
              For example, if you're working 12 hours a day, you need to determine why. Are you taking on too many responsibilities? If so, start saying no and begin delegating appropriate tasks to others.
              You might be working 12 hours a day because you’re looking at your phone every five minutes. Experiment with turning off your phone when you’re working. You’ll get more done in less time.

              The first step in time management is to evaluate how you spend your time on daily tasks. You can use a time-tracking app or the ol' pen-and-paper method to record what you're doing, when and for how long.</p>

              <p class="subtitle">Organize your time wisely</p>

              <p>Time management is hard. If you want to become successful at time management, you need to start using a planner. This can be either a weekly paper version or a computer software program -- whatever you’re comfortable with. Ideally, it should come with a calendar app function so you can schedule your time more effectively, as well as remind yourself of important events and tasks.

              Coach Marie Forleo advises "If it’s not scheduled, it’s not real." In your planner, list every activity that involves scheduling. This includes appointments, project deadlines, exercise and social events. Don't schedule activities every hour of every day -- that leads to frustration. You need blocks of time for breaks and when the unexpected occurs.</p>
  
              <p class="subtitle">Plan, prioritise and follow through on tasks </p>

              <p>Many people fail at time management because they haven't planned, prioritized and followed through on tasks. The best way to correct this is by creating a routine.

              To get started, create a weekly schedule comprised of essential tasks, such as responding to emails or doing laundry. Next, establish set block times for these essential tasks. Because you’ve already evaluated how your time is spent, you should have a ballpark estimate of how much time you should set aside for each task. Be consistent and keep the times the same throughout the week. For example, if you check your email at 8 a.m., schedule that at 8 a.m. every day.
              
              For larger tasks, break them up into smaller chunks. This makes the task more manageable; you can set aside a realistic time to work on each chunk.
              
              To prevent yourself from getting overwhelmed, follow the “Rule of 3.” Chris Bailey, author of the book "The Productivity Project," writes that “having just three items to focus on throughout the day and week will help you stay centered and accomplish more, even on days when everything hits the fan.”</p>

              <p class="subtitle">Give everything a home </p>

              <p>The average American spends 2.5 days each year looking for lost items. Additionally, around a quarter of Americans misplace their house or car keys twice a week. That’s time that could have been better spent. And it can easily be avoided with this one trick: Give everything a “home.”

              For example, you car keys should go on a hook next to the front door. Your financial records should be kept in a dedicated folder in a filing cabinet. You should use a password manager so your login information is in one location.
              
              Also, whatever you’re not using should be thrown away or stored elsewhere. This way, it won’t distract you or eat up valuable space needed for essential items. You may want to use an open bookcase or transparent containers so you can avoid "out of sight, out of mind" thinking.</p>

              <p class="subtitle">Drop bad habits</p>

              <p>One of the reasons you may be disorganized is because you've developed bad habits that are preventing you from being organized. If you want to get better at time management, you need to drop those bad habits, such as taking on more than you can handle. This happens frequently when you have just started your own business and are doing everything yourself. As a result, nothing gets done. Learn your limits and how to say no. Remember, it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver.

              Another bad habit is relying on your memory. No matter how great your memory is, it can fail you. We often need a brain dump or get distracted by something else. Carry a notebook with you at all times to jot down everything from thoughts and ideas to meeting notes so you can refer to it when you need to
                
              Multitasking, surprisingly, is also a bad habit. Doing several things at once isn't effective. Instead of helping us get more done at once, it takes us longer to complete tasks because our brains are switching back and forth between tasks. Focus on completing one task at a time. </p>
                
               
              <p class="subtitle">Learn how to manage external time wasters</p>

              <p>There will be times when your time is affected by external factors, like unexpected visitors or meetings that drag on. There are a few ways you can learn how to manage these outside forces. One is by setting a specific time to respond to phone calls and emails. When you're working, turn your notifications off and use voicemail.

              Another is establishing blocks of time when you’re free to meet. When you’re not available, you can keep your door closed, place a "do not disturb" sign outside or politely ask people to return at a more convenient time.
  
              Only plan meetings that are absolutely necessary; make sure there’s an agenda in advance and a facilitator so the meeting stays on track and ends on time.</p>

              <p>Being disorganized doesn't have to be a curse. Focus on finding a time management technique that works for you. Just because one person has had success using a certain technique doesn’t mean it’s the right fit for you. Don’t be afraid to try out several different ideas until you find the one that helps you manage your time best.

        <p class="title">8 Effective Time Management Tips for Moms</p>

            </p>Time management is a big concern for mothers these days. Between kids’ activities, household responsibilities and, for many, the demands of a stressful workplace, many mothers have given up on the fight to find time for themselves and are just trying to get everything done. The following time management tips can be used by busy moms everywhere to take some of the stress out of life, and create more time for fun times with children, quality time with their partner, or even that coveted and nearly forgotten alone time.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Be Organized</p>

            <p>It’s been said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and nowhere is this adage more applicable than when discussing time management tips for moms. Simply being organized can eliminate stress from forgotten appointments, double-booking, lost homework, and many other stress traps that busy moms face.</p>
          
            <p>What does it mean for a mom to ‘be organized,’ and to what extent is this even possible? If you focus on a few key areas of organization, a little work can go a long way. In a nutshell, being organized with your schedule, with your house, and with your discipline strategy is one of the best time management tips you can get. And this may seem like a lot, but once you have a few plans and systems in place, if you set a regular time to check-in with these plans (like, if you look over each day's plans the night before and always remember to keep things on a calendar), it will be far easier to maintain a comfortable level of organization. </p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Delegate!</p>

            <p>Yes, when they come to us, they are so sweet and helpless, we end up doing everything for them, and these habits are difficult to break. But then we have their children and realize that it’s impossible for one person to do it all.</p>
          
            <p>While it’s tempting to cover all household responsibilities yourself (to ensure that everything is done quickly and correctly), putting some effort into getting partners and children to pitch in can really pay off in the long run.
          
            The trick is to break chores into simple tasks and reward people for doing them.</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Multitask—but Only When Appropriate</p>

            <p>Multitasking was once praised as the time management tip to top all-time management tips. (Imagine: Getting twice as much done in a day.) Then people started seeing that multitasked projects weren’t completed as accurately, and suddenly ‘staying focused on one thing’ became the new time management fad. How about a compromise? Pair mindless tasks with focus-dependent ones when it’s appropriate. For example, you can make business calls while taking your daily walk (don’t forget exercise as an important stress reliever), or quiz your kids on test questions while you clean the kitchen. But if you feel more harried than helped, it’s time to shelve the multitasking for a bit.</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Learn When to Say No</p>

            <p> Learning to say ‘no’ to people’s requests may be an obvious time management tip for moms, but that doesn’t make it an easy one. Mothers encounter many different worthy requests for their time and attention, that saying no will often disappoint someone. However, what we don’t always realize is that when we say ‘yes’ too much, people also get disappointed because we can’t do our best when we’re spread too thin. That’s why it’s important to look at your priorities and learn to say no to time demands that aren’t absolutely necessary.</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Take Shortcuts</p>

            <p>If you can get pre-cut vegetables or canned sauce for dinner, do it. If you can afford one of those dishwashers that can handle un-rinsed dishes, even better. The time management tip to remember here is to find the shortest route to where you need to be (getting to the office, getting homework done, getting the house clean), and take it.</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Have a Routine</p>
          
            <p>Routine​s are a time management tip that can save you mental energy and stress. We're not talking about merely getting up and going to sleep at the same time, but even having things like the dinner menu, chore rotation, and even sex with your partner on a rotation (you have your needs, too). This may sound a little ‘too automated,’ but think about it. When you don’t have to worry about reinventing the wheel each week (“What haven’t we eaten in a while?” “When was this floor last mopped?” “When is the last time we…?”), your mind is free to focus on the rest of your day, and the time it takes to plan these things each week is freed as well.</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Be Flexible</p>

            <p>While it’s important to have an idea of how you’d like your schedule to look, it’s important to keep things flexible enough to accommodate the unexpected things that moms encounter like sick kids, spilled milk, and the occasional meltdown. Having a rhythm for your day but a time cushion and some backup plans can take the stress out of the unexpected, and keep one schedule hiccup from throwing off your whole day (or week).</p>
          
            <p class="subtitle">Take Care of Yourself, Too!</p>

            <p>While taking care of parental, relationship, household and workplace responsibilities, it’s easy for mothers to put taking care of themselves last on the list. However, not only is self-care a good idea of physical and emotional health, it’s a good time management tip for moms as well. When we’re tired or haven’t had enough healthy food to function at our best, we’re often less productive and organized, and this lack of clarity can translate into more time wasted throughout the day and less time available to get everything done that needs doing. So get quality sleep, eat a healthy diet, and follow other self care strategies for mothers, and you’ll be operating at your best — and less stressed.</p>

          <p class="title">Time Management Tips for the Disorganized </p>
          <p class="subtitle">Aligned with the right tile</p>
          <div class="content is-normal">
            <p>We all know people who seem to simply be naturally disorganized. Maybe some of us consider ourselves to be in that group as well. But time management is crucial to success in one’s career.</p>
      
            <p> Time not only does effective time management allow us to take on multiple high-profile and important roles or activities at once but it also lets us spend time on networking, personal development, and other career-building activities.
            Fortunately, being naturally disorganized isn’t an incurable barrier to career growth. Here, we take a look at how we can apply these tips to maximize our own personal effectiveness.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Evaluate How You Spend Your Time</p>
            We all start on a level playing field when it comes to time management. Each of us is allocated 24 hours in a day. No more. No less. According to John Rampton, contributor to Entrepreneur, how we spend that time, though, is certainly variable.
            The first step in mastering time management involves looking at what you’re doing currently. Think critically. Are you taking too many breaks? Are there tasks you can delegate? Are you simply taking on too many responsibilities?</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Organize Your Time Wisely</p>
    
            <p>Next is about how you might better organize your time in a tangible way. Effective time management won’t just happen. It’s important to use tools like planners or calendars to schedule activities for your day, week, month, etc. If you don’t, you’re likely to get surprised by tight deadlines for big commitments.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Plan, Prioritize, and Follow Through on Tasks</p>
            
            <p>Create a routine where you plan, prioritize, and follow through on your tasks. This could involve blocking off the first 2 hours of your Mondays to plan out your week and blocking off time throughout the week to focus on key priorities.
