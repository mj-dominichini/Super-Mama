      <p class="title">Where to Start When Organizing Your Home </p>

      <div class="content is-normal">

      <p>How you organize your home ultimately comes down to preference, but there are some guidelines to help you streamline the process. It's often best to begin with your storage areas. This will allow you to free up storage space by getting rid of stored items you don't need anymore before you tackle the rest of your home and encounter items that need putting away. If you're ready to go on an organizing journey, here are some tips to get you started.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">01 Storage Spaces</p>

      <p>The first step of your organizing process is to make sure your storage spaces are neat and free of clutter, so they'll be able to accommodate items from other areas of your home. Think of it like this: Before you unload groceries, you have to create space for them to go in the fridge and pantry.

      Start with a project you can easily complete, such as organizing a junk drawer. Then, move on to a hall closet or a storage area in your basement. Divide large storage spaces into smaller zones, so the organization task doesn't feel so daunting. And if necessary, invest in organizational systems, such as a closet organizer or storage bins, so everything has a place that will be easily accessible.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">02 Shared Spaces</p>

      <p>Shared spaces—such as the kitchen, living room, and bathroom—should be organized next because they are the most trafficked areas in the home. A benefit to organizing these areas is it could prompt others in your household to be neater and join your organization efforts.

      Within these areas, plan to declutter and find a designated home for all of the items that live there. Collaborate with members of your household on where shared items should go, so you all know where everything is and everyone will return items to their proper places. For example, if you have children, let them help you pick a storage space for their toys in the living room. This might cause them to feel a sense of ownership over the project and make them more likely to work within the organizational system.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">03 Personal Spaces</p> 

      <p>Personal spaces—including bedrooms, closets, and home offices—can take some effort to organize because they often involve assessing many items. For instance, when organizing your closet, you have to make decisions about whether to keep, donate, or toss all of the items in your wardrobe. And in an office, you might have a lot of paperwork to go through and either file or shred.

      Plus, you're the only one who can make decisions about how to organize your personal spaces. Set up a system that works for your lifestyle. For instance, you might prefer to organize your closet by type of clothing, such as all your shirts together and all your pants together. Or you might like to sort it by outfit to make the process of selecting something to wear easier.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">04 Small Spaces</p> 

      <p>In general, you can save the small and out-of-the-way spaces of your home for the last step of your organization journey. Such spaces include the laundry room, linen closet, mudroom, and guest room. Unless these spaces are extremely disorganized, you probably can live with a little clutter in them as you get the main areas of your home in order. But ultimately having them organized too will lead to a more efficient lifestyle for you.

      For example, if you have last-minute guests coming to stay with you, you'll be happy you already have a tidy guest room. And having an organized linen closet can make it much easier to locate extra towels and toiletries, as well as to know what you're running out of. Plus, an organized laundry room can make doing laundry a more enjoyable chore when everything you need is at your fingertips.</p>

      <p class="title">How to Organize Your Pantry in 10 Steps + Essential Products You Will Need</p>
      <div class="content is-normal">
      <p class="subtitle"></p>
     
    
      <p>Organizing the pantry is no small feat. You need patience and a keen eye to sort through all of the canned goods, cereal boxes, snack pouches and miscellaneous baking ingredients that have piled up. And then, once everything's organized, you need the whole family's cooperation to keep your pantry tidy.

      But first, you need a game plan — which is where we come in. Here are 10 simple steps for organizing your pantry, plus our go-to products to help you get started.</p>
         
      <p class="subtitle">Things to look for in Pantry Organizers</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transparency: While it's certainly tempting to purchase matte black or glazed ivory canisters, we suggest sticking with clear bins as much as possible. The transparent sides will allow you to see your supplies and keep track of what's still in stock. Clear bins are also easier to mix and match, which will help your space look more uniform.</li>

          <li>Stackability: Every inch of space counts in a pantry. So, when shopping for food storage containers, consider how they'll fit together. Square or rectangular containers with flat lids stack easily and will allow you to fit more items on the same shelf.</li>

          <li>Functionality: Your organizers should make sense for the whole family. (Note: If they're easy to use, your partner or children will be more likely to keep the pantry clean.) If you have little kids, look for large open bins or containers with easy pop or flip-up lids. If you have tweens or teens, opt for containers with locking or screw-top lids for an airtight seal.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="subtitle">1. Start with a Clean Slate</p>

      <p>Empty your entire pantry, and thoroughly clean it before you begin the organization process. Check expiration dates, and toss anything that's past its prime or no longer in use. This will free up space in your pantry and help things stay organized longer.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">2. Take inventory</p>

      <p>After clearing out old items, you can easily see what's left to organize and start assigning storage containers. Make a list of your pantry staples and update it regularly. When it's time to go grocery shopping, take your list with you.</p>
        
      <p class="subtitle">3. Categorize</p>

      <p>Next, place like items together. A lazy Susan makes it easy to keep oils, condiments, snacks or baking essentials in one place so you can quickly find what you need.</p>
 
      <p class="subtitle">4. Use clear containers</p>

      <p>Busy packaging can make your pantry look cluttered. Remove any plastic bags or cardboard boxes, and decant dry ingredients into clear canisters. Odd-shaped items, like chip bags and root vegetables, fit nicely in bins as opposed to being stacked loosely on the shelf. Choose clear food storage containers to keep everything looking cohesive.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">5. Label</p>

      <p>Label bins, containers and shelves so every member of your household knows where items are located. Use a Bluetooth label maker for quick labeling or chalkboard labels so you can easily update the writing.</p>

      <figure class="image is-4by3">
        <img src="/images/door_space.jpg">
      </figure>

      <p class="subtitle">6. Utilize Doors</p>

      <p>If you have doors on your pantry, hang organizers over them to free up shelf space. Canned goods, spices, oils and jars are usually good fits for these types of organizers.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">7. Make a Kid Friendly Spot</p>

      <p>Fill a bottom shelf with water bottles, snack bins and cereal dispensers, so your kiddos can help put away groceries and grab something to eat. Use bins with built-in dividers to offer a variety of healthy choices (like protein bars, fruit gummies and crackers). Visibility and labeling are key so kids can keep up the organization.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">8. Use Extra Wall Space</p>

      <p>If you have it, wall space can be a game-changer for organizing a pantry. Hooks can hold non-food items like aprons, brooms and reusable grocery bags. You can also use a wall-mounted bag dispenser to hold trash bags and easily replace what's in the can.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">9. Add Shelf Liners</p>

      <p>Shelf liners can help prevent produce from falling through wire shelves and boxes from tipping over. Liners can also keep wet ingredients, like oils and condiments, from slipping off the shelves and spilling onto the floor.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">10. Keep it up</p>

      <p>Your pantry can get disorganized after a while. To help maintain your space, always put items back in their appropriate spot, and get the whole family on board by keeping food accessible and visible. Schedule a quick cleaning twice a month to make sure that everything is up-to-date and in place, so you don't have to spend hours organizing again.</p>

    <p class="title mt-4">Why an Organized Home Can Be an Effective Stress Management Tool </p>
    <div class="content is-normal">
    
     <p>People experience plenty of stress from jobs, finances, and other areas of their lives. When we come home, we want to feel like we’re entering a refuge, safe from the demands of life. But does your home provide a safe harbor from stress, or is it causing you additional stress that you might not be aware of? </p>
       
     <p> If you have a cluttered, poorly decorated, or somewhat disorganized living space, home relaxation can be virtually impossible.</p>

     <p class="title mt-5">Reasons Why You Should Organize Your Home to Reduce Stress </p> 

    <p> With a little work, your home could be another stress management tool at your disposal. Here’s why.</p>
      
    <p class="subtitle">Clutter Causes Stress</p>

    <p> Just sitting in a cluttered room can create stress. Whether you view it in feng shui terms as "stagnant chi," in cerebral terms as too much information for the eye to process, or in practical terms as a visual reminder of how much work you need to do to get your house clean, you probably already know that mess means stress.</p>
      
    <p> Living in a cluttered home can create constant low-grade stress and subtly but steadily drain your energy.</p>
      
    <p class="subtitle">Soothing Surroundings Are Nurturing</p>
      
    <p> Being in a space characterized by order, tranquility, and a physical manifestation of your tastes, on the other hand, can soothe you and help release stress. This is how marketers sell products from catalogs so efficiently. They are really ‘selling’ the sense of peace that comes from the beauty of the picture as much as they’re selling the products contained in that picture of a beautiful room.</p>
      
    <p> Coming home to an orderly home can help you feel like you’re entering a sanctuary away from the stresses of the outside world.</p>
           
    <p class="subtitle">Organization Saves Time, Money, and Other Resources</p>
      
    <p>A messy, disorganized home can cost you more than just your inner peace. If you don’t have a ‘home’ for all of your belongings, you spend more time trying to put things away when you’re cleaning up, and waste time looking for items when you need them.</p>
      
    <p> If you don’t have an organized system for filing your bills and other important papers, you may end up paying things late, which results in fees and additional stress. There are many other ways that you don't even realize your mess may be draining your resources.</p>
      
    <p class="subtitle">Order May Bring More Good Things</p>

    <p>Followers of the Chinese discipline feng shui believe that a well-ordered home aligns vital energy in your life to bring good fortune in other areas of your life. Others simply enjoy the soothing surroundings and pleasing aesthetics that come with the balanced decorating style that feng shui espouses. </p>
      
    <p> Whether or not you believe that feng shui brings special good fortune, it’s hard to argue that an organized home wouldn’t bring additional benefits, chief among them being reduced stress.</p>
      
    <p class="subtitle">A Word From Verywell</p>

    <p> Any time is the right time to create an organized, soothing home atmosphere. You can simplify your life and reduce the daily stress you experience by putting in relatively minimal effort to de-clutter, organize, and decorate your home. </p>

    <div class="content is-normal">
    <p class="subtitle has-text-warning">(and How to Fix It) :</p>
    
    <p>I remember a time in my life when I was so overwhelmed by my schedule, I didn’t know how to break free. 
    I was so hellbent on controlling everything and everyone in my life that I struggled to delegate tasks.  
    I felt busy all the time yet I didn’t seem to be getting any further ahead. I thought MY way was the ONLY way (of course!).
        
    As a result, my relationships with my husband and children suffered. And so did my health. 
        
    I was mentally and emotionally exhausted from trying to keep the schedules of three other people, as well as my own to-do lists, events, goals and priorities straight in my head.  Eventually, I realised I was becoming a disorganized person.
        
    I had read every life-changing book and tried every productivity and organisation app on the market. I’d even attempted to stick post-it notes around my house. That’s when I realized that trying to find a work life balance is BS because it doesn’t exist. We have ONE life to live – not one life with a work compartment and a life compartment! 
        
    I realized quickly that I needed a central place where I could dump my work, business and family commitments in one happy place.
        
    I needed to declutter my brain so I could feel organized, prioritize what was most important to me and reclaim a sense of calm that I didn’t even realize I was missing. 
        
    I actually couldn’t find that happy place… so I created it. And in 2015,  the Life Sorted app was born. </p> 
        
    <p class="subtitle">There could be many reasons you’re so disorganized</p>

    <p> There are many reasons for disorganization including perfectionism, lack of skills, our beliefs and indecision, as well as mental health and brain-related conditions. When we understand the reason, it can help increase our ability to become more organized (and stay that way!).</p>
        
    <p class="subtitle">Signs of a disorganized person</p>

    <p> Okay, you may or may not have sweaty palms as you read this list and realize that some (or all!) of these apply to you!
        
    But the good news is, I’m also giving you an action step you can take to try to fix it!
        
      <ul>
        <li>You’re often late for appointments.</li>
        <li> You can’t find anything (I see you – reprinting things you’ve already printed, buying another stapler because your other one went walking!)</li>

        <li> You always seem to be hit with surprise deadlines (What do you mean it’s her birthday… again?!)</li>
        <li> You’re making the moolah but you never seem to have enough money.</li>
        <li> You run out of household supplies when you need them (repeat after me… tissues are NOT the same as toilet paper)</li>
        <li> Communication in your life is causing havoc, your phone storage is always full, your computer files are everywhere (and nowhere!), and you’re often misunderstood. </li>
        
        And this one may come as a surprize…
        
        <li> You’re NOT willing to take a risk.When all of your ducks are not in a row to begin with, it can be challenging to add any more uncertainty or spontaneity into your life.</li> 
      </ul>
        
      Sound familiar? Let’s look at why it’s so important to find a way to become more organized.</p>
        
      <p class="subtitle">Why is organization important?</p>

      <p> When we are organized and our home and brain is free from clutter, we feel more calm and are able to focus and be more productive. We are also able to connect to those around us and be more spontaneous and fun without feeling overwhelmed, anxious or stressed.
        
      If we feel good, this has a positive impact on other people in our lives. So, are you ready to crack the code about why you’re so disorganized? I’ll also give you some practical tips to help you fix it!</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Here are 5 reasons you’re so disorganized (and how to fix it!)</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Your beliefs</li>
        
          <p> Your beliefs about material objects in your life make it difficult and seemingly impossible for you to let go of things, people, ideas and emotions from the past. Having a cluttered home (or brain!) makes it difficult for you to feel organized and impedes your ability to focus and be productive. According to NBC News, evidence suggests that when multiple visual stimuli are competing for your attention, you have a harder time focusing. 
        
          THE FIX: Mari Kondo-ing your life. If you’ve not heard of Mari Kondo before, you really need to check out this article that teaches you how I KonMari my brain before doing anything else. And if you’re looking for a quick fix – check out the easy way to declutter your home (and your life!).</p>
        
          <li>Procrastination</li>

          <p> You delay starting or completing tasks. There are so many causes of procrastination, including fear of the unknown, you believe you’ll do it later, indecision, working on small tasks or the wrong tasks because they’re easier, a lack of motivation, you don’t know how to begin, you know the task will require effort and hard work, or you get distracted. A big cause of procrastination is perfectionism.
        
          THE FIX: Write a list of the things you need to do. Use Eisenhower’s urgent/important principle to prioritize what needs to be actioned first and to help you manage your time effectively. Even if you feel ‘too busy’ try adding some exercise into your day. You’ll be surprized by the mindset benefits of exercise. After you complete a task, why not reward yourself with a little ‘me time’. Who says rewards as incentives don’t work for adults!?   </p>
  
        <li>Perfectionism</li>

        <p> You have an unrealistic expectation that everything will be perfect all of the time (and you most probably don’t think that this is an unrealistic expectation!). Many factors – including fear of disapproval from others or feelings of insecurity and inadequacy – can contribute to developing perfectionism. While I consider myself to be a Recovering Perfectionist, perfectionism still rears its ugly head from time to time, causing anxiety and inaction.
        
        THE FIX: While there is no quick fix, reminding yourself to ‘be present where you are with the people you’re with’ or ‘done is better than perfect’ may be helpful. Reduce perfectionist tendencies by learning how to minimize brain clutter. Check out my secret weapon to combat brain-clutter here. You can also dive into The Gifts Of Imperfectionism by Brene Brown, where she shares how you can overcome paralyzing fear and self-consciousness and strengthen your connection to the world.</p>
        
       <li>Lack of focus </li>

        <p> One of the reasons your so disorganized is an inability to focus. When we’re distracted, don’t have clear priorities and don’t have a way to control our brain clutter, it is difficult to be focused and organized. My friends and family often ask me how I manage to focus on my goals and always seem to get everything done. The truth is, I help myself focus by doing three simple things – streamlining, systemising and automating. Check out how you can you use this simple three step process to help you focus and get sh*t done in your life too!
        
        THE FIX: To increase your productivity while working, try brain dumping your to-do list before you start. You can add your to-do list for the day into the list section of an app like Life Sorted.  During work time you can use the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique helps you manage your time and improve your focus and productivity by breaking it into 25 minute intervals with designated short or long break between each period. You can easily add the Marinara: Pomodoro Assistant aka a tomato timer as a Chrome extension. For a bit of fun, visit Coffitivity, which gives you atmosphere noises of being in a coffee shop to improve your focus as you work. </p> 
        
        <li>Indecision </li> 

         <p>  One of the biggest causes of disorganization is indecisiveness. Getting organized requires taking action and action requires decision-making. Disorganization can often be the result of delayed decision-making. But how do you work out what your priorities should be and what tasks you should action first? It’s important to remind yourself that not everything is important and it can’t all be important at once. You’re only human after all!  
        
        THE FIX: Change your mindset around the word ‘priority’. The word ‘priority’ means ‘one thing’. We made up the word priorities and overcomplicated things for ourselves. The reality is that you can’t have a lot of priorities because that’s not the meaning of the word. Using a simple framework, such as the 4-D Framework to combat brain clutter will help you decide if you should DO, DELEGATE, DEFER or DITCH the task. This will help you understand and prioritize what is urgent vs what is important so you can be more decisive and take action faster.</p>

      </ol>
        
      <p class="subtitle"> Conclusion</p>
     
       <p> A disorganized mind can be paralyzing. When we know why we are disorganized, it becomes so much easier to fix it. Life is short –  it’s so important that we are living our best life that is as streamlined and as stress-free as possible. We can do this by working on improving some of our habits that keep us disorganized and stuck so that we can spend more time doing the things we are passionate about with the people that we love. What are your favourite hacks for getting (and staying!) organized?</p>
